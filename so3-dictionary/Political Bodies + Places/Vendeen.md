A single-planet nation located in the <span class="races">[[Vendeeni]]</span> System.  First contact was made in 710 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>.
Although the <span class="races">[[Vendeeni]]</span> possess little power, the sophistication of their science exceeds that of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> and <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Aldian Empire]]</span>.  
This has allowed the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Vendeen]]</span> to maintain its neutrality despite the delicate balance of power in the region.
The <span class="races">[[Vendeeni]]</span> are not hostile to the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span>, but on the other hand, they are not particularly friendly either.

# Part 2

For unknown reasons, the <span class="races">[[Vendeeni]]</span> attacked <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Hyda IV]]</span> with devastating force and kidnapped <span class="people">[[Robert Leingod|Professor Leingod]]</span>--the most distinguished scientist of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span>--and have now mobilized another attack force in order to secure the person of <span class="people">[[Fayt Leingod|Fayt]]</span>.
Although they are powerful enough to field an attack force, it is very odd that the <span class="races">[[Vendeeni]]</span>, who are vastly inferior in overall military power, would perpetrate such a rash act.

# Part 3

The Vendeeni, masters of space-time theory, have become aware of the fact that their universe was created by the inhabitants of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[4D Space|4D space]]</span>.
Not only that, they have also come to understand that <span class="miscellaneous">[[Symbology|symbology]]</span> possesses the ability to rewrite the language that describes the universe, thereby destroying the axioms the order of their world is based on.
The <span class="races">[[Vendeeni]]</span> feared not the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span>, nor the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Aldian Empire]]</span>, but rather the <span class="races">[[4D Being|4D beings]]</span> who created them.
If the <span class="races">[[4D Being|4D beings]]</span> destroy civilizations that have gone too far, then the <span class="races">[[Vendeeni]]</span> see no option than to stop the progress of civilization itself.
Unfortunately, the ignorant <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> have already gone past the point of no return.
Even worse, they have gone so far as to rebel against the <span class="races">[[4D Being|4D beings]]</span> who created the universe.
If the Creator is selective when deciding who to destroy, then the <span class="races">[[Vendeeni]]</span> reason that all they need to do is hide from the Creator's gaze.
The <span class="races">[[Vendeeni]]</span> see this as difficult, but not impossible.  However, if the Creator is angry at the entire universe, and if the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Destruction|destruction]]</span> is to be indiscriminate, then this is a different story altogether.
The <span class="races">[[Vendeeni]]</span>, who see their own path to salvation, view the research of <span class="people">[[Robert Leingod|Dr. Leingod]]</span> as unforgivable, since it may result in the destruction of the entire galaxy.
