A <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> base orbiting Hyda III that patrols and protects approximately half of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kappa Sector]]</span> (including Hyda System itself), as well as part of the Iota Sector.
This base includes three <span class="miscellaneous">[[Battle-Class Ship|battle-class ships]]</span>, with the GFAS1144 Argyll acting as the mothership, ten <span class="miscellaneous">[[Combat Explorer|combat explorers]]</span>, and twelve research explorers/transport ships.  This base's fleet is smaller because there are no powers in the region that are hostile to the Pangalactic Federation.
General Birmingham (male, age 54) is the current base commander.
