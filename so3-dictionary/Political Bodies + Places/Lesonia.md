A planet located in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Gamma Sector]]</span>.
Gravitational anomalies abound in the region surrounding <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Lesonia]]</span>. It used to boast a huge sphere of influence thanks to the warp tunnels that used these anomalies for faster-than-light travel.
Unfortunately, this method of travel is one-way only, and only leads to specific destinations, so when warp technology was developed, the power of this planet dwindled rapidly.
(As of the present date of 772 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>, only a few useful two-way routes have been discovered.)
