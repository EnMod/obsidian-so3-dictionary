The presence of two races has been confirmed on this underdeveloped planet.  One is a marine race known as the <span class="races">[[Edifian|Edifians]]</span>, and the other is a race of <span class="races">[[Human|Humans]]</span> that is very similar to the <span class="races">[[Earthling]]</span> race.
Since <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Edifice]]</span> is an underdeveloped planet, there have not been any detailed investigations, but the existence of an advanced ancient civilization has been conjectured due to the so-called "Gift" they left behind as a legacy.
