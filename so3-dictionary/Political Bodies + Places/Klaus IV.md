The fourth planet in Klaus System, <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Klaus IV]]</span> has an atmospheric 
composition that is almost completely made up of carbon dioxide.
<span class="political-bodies-places">[[Klaus IV]]</span> has an axial tilt of 11.2', is 1.8 AUs from its parent star, and has a gravity of 0.6 G.
Although it used to be sterile and devoid of any life forms, as the population of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Klaus III]]</span> increased, colonization proceeded, and now one fourth of all <span class="races">[[Klausian|Klausians]]</span> live in habitation domes constructed on this planet.
The <span class="miscellaneous">[[Atmospheric Composition|atmospheric composition]]</span> and gravity of the areas underneath the habitation domes are adjusted to resemble that of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Klaus III]]</span>, and therefore life is possible underneath the domes without any noticeable difference.  The total number of <span class="races">[[Klausian|Klausians]]</span> living in the galaxy at present is estimated at around twelve billion.
