Located in <span class="miscellaneous">[[Sector]]</span> Lambda, the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Estoch System]]</span> includes seven planets and countless asteroids in orbit around the primary.
This system began developing at a sudden and dramatic pace when a vein of dielectric bauxite-a component of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Superconducting Aluminum|superconducting aluminum]]</span>-was found on the outermost of the seven planets.
However, since it is located in a border zone close to the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Aldian Empire]]</span>, and because the dielectric bauxite has already been tapped out by the large numbers of miners working in this system, it is now almost entirely deserted.
