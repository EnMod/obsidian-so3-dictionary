A mountain beyond <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Duggus Forest]]</span> and one of the few remaining locations where <span class="miscellaneous">[[Palmira's Flower|Palmira's Flowers]]</span> can still be found within the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Sacred Kingdom of Aquaria]]</span>.
The fact that <span class="people">[[Ameena Leffeld|Ameena]]</span> and her friends can so easily travel there would seem to indicate that there is a back road to the peak known only to a few people.
The mountain itself is considerably distant from <span class="races">[[Human|human]]</span> habitations, so <span class="people">[[Nel Zelpher|Nel]]</span> cannot be blamed for not knowing of this back road.
