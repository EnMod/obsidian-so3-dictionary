Called Frozen <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Arakh]]</span>, as its surface is covered with nitrogen ice, it is the seventh planet of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Estoch System]]</span>, which is located near <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Federation Station 17|Federation Station #17]]</span>.
<span class="political-bodies-places">[[Arakh|Arakh's]]</span> axial tilt is 87.6', it is 7.6 AUs from its parent star, and its surface gravity is 1.4 G.
The thin atmosphere of this nearly uninhabitable planet is mostly comprised of helium gas.
In spite of the harsh environment, a mining station has been established on <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Arakh]]</span> since mass quantities of precious metals can be excavated from beneath the thick ice.
