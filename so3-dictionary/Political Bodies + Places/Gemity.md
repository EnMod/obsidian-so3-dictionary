A city existing for the amusement of the non-working class that makes up the majority of the 4D universe's population.
It was developed and is operated by <span class="miscellaneous">[[Sphere]]</span>, the same company that developed the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Eternal Sphere]]</span>.  Within <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Gemity]]</span>, it is possible to fully experience the virtual universe of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Eternal Sphere]]</span> as if you are there.  In other words, it's just like an amusement park.
