A <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> base that used to orbit the planet Rahva III.
As the closest military base to the territory of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Aldian Empire]]</span>, it suffered endless and devastating attacks by the Aldian forces.
Seven years ago, in 765 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>, it was brutally attacked by a fleet of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Aldian Empire]]</span>.  Damage sustained in the attack caused the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Engine]]</span> inside the base to malfunction, completely annihilating it.

Seven years ago, this facility was vaporized by a <span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Engine]]</span> that malfunctioned during a vicious attack by the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Aldian Empire]]</span>.
A swarm of asteroids routed from deep space smashed into this base.
