A complex of torrid caves in which <span class="races">[[Air Dragon|air dragons]]</span> congregate.  The <span class="races">[[Air Dragon|air dragons]]</span> gain power as they age, and are under the leadership of <span class="people">[[Crosell]]</span>, who is known as the Lord of <span class="races">[[Air Dragon|Air Dragons]]</span>.
It would be no exaggeration to say that every last soldier in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Airyglyph]]</span> dreams of the day when they can sign a contract with one of the <span class="races">[[Air Dragon|air dragons]]</span> living in this cave complex.
The <span class="miscellaneous">[[Dragon Brigade]]</span> in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Airyglyph]]</span> boasts a large number of knights who ride <span class="races">[[Air Dragon|air dragons]]</span>, but as of yet, only two people have succeeded in taming one of the <span class="races">[[Air Dragon|air dragons]]</span> living in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Urssa Lava Caves]]</span>--King <span class="people">[[Airyglyph XIII]]</span> and <span class="people">[[Duke Vox]]</span> (the commander of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Dragon Brigade]]</span>).
