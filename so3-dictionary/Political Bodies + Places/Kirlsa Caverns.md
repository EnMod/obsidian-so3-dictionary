A gigantic tunnel through a mountain range connecting <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kirlsa]]</span> and the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Bequerel Mountain Path]]</span>.
These artificial caverns were built over the course of ten years, in order to make it easier to access the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Bequerel Mountain Path]]</span>, which contains many veins of ore.  Domesticated <span class="races">[[Hauler Beast|Hauler Beasts]]</span> allow large shipments of materials to be transported through the caverns.
