The third planet of the Klaus System, <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Klaus III]]</span> has no seasons due to its axial tilt of 0.4', is 1.2 AUs away from its parent star, and has a gravity of 2.4 G.
Its atmosphere has only two-thirds of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Earth|Earth's]]</span> oxygen in terms of density.  The oxygen is replaced by additional nitrogen.
It is thought that the severity of this environment--low oxygen density and heavy gravity--is responsible for giving the <span class="races">[[Klausian|Klausians]]</span> their incredible physical capabilities.
