A place where inhabitants of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[4D Space|4D space]]</span> utilize spatial conjuncture technology, which is the preferred mode of travel in this universe.
At first glance, the technology resembles the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Transporter|transporters]]</span> used in the Milky Way, but in actuality, the two systems are completely different.  
<span class="miscellaneous">[[Transporter|Transporters]]</span> simultaneously delete and create matter at two separate locations to mimic transportation, but within such a station, spatial conjunctions that lead to other locations are actually formed.
To prevent crime, however, use of this <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Spacetime Station]]</span> is restricted by requiring governmental approval for each specific destination coordinate.  The system does not allow anyone to freely travel anywhere they want.
