A planet located in the Arkula System of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Sector]]</span> Theta that has an <span class="miscellaneous">[[Atmospheric Composition|atmospheric composition]]</span> and surface gravity approximately identical to those of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Earth]]</span>.
This naturally beautiful world is currently enjoying a period of stability, but at one point in its past the high density of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Energy Stone|Energy Stones]]</span> distributed throughout its atmosphere polluted the entire planet.
This mysterious pollution, which began in 366 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>, continued for several years, and affected the psyches of many of the planet's wild animals, causing them to ferociously attack the native <span class="races">[[Expelian|Expelians]]</span>.
However, in 371 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>, Dr. Neuyman succeeded in developing his <span class="miscellaneous">[[Neuyman Purifier]]</span>, a device that was able to remove this pollution.
This cleaner worked wonderfully, removing most of the pollution by the very next year, and thereby eliminating almost all of the negative influence of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Energy Stone|Energy Stones]]</span>.  Recognizing the value of this technology, <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Expel]]</span> was invited to join the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> at the end of the same year.
Because Expel is one of the few planets that generate <span class="miscellaneous">[[Energy Stone|Energy St<span class="miscellaneous">[[Energy Stone|Energy Stones]]</span>-a necessity in the creation of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Quadratic Key|Quadratic<span class="miscellaneous">[[Quadratic Key|Quadratic Keys]]</span>-the planet is an extremely influential voice within the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span>.  The current Prime Minister of Expel is Ms. Eleanor T. Kross (age 36).
