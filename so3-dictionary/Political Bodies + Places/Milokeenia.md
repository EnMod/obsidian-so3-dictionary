An uninhabited planet in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Theta Sector]]</span>.
The former inhabitants of this planet had a well-developed 
civilization, and the ruins of a gigantic, dome-shaped structure can be found on the planet.
This dome is famous as the place where the amazing <span class="miscellaneous">[[OPA]]</span> known as 
<span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Energy]]</span> was discovered.  This event drastically changed the course of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation|Pangalactic Federation's]]</span> history.
When the ruins remaining on this planet were examined and analyzed, it was discovered that the collapse of a ruin triggers the release of a tremendous amount of energy equivalent to <span class="miscellaneous">[[Magnitude|magnitude 1]]</span> from inside.  
Therefore, it is generally believed that the civilization was destroyed by <span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Energy]]</span> running amok as it was being researched.
