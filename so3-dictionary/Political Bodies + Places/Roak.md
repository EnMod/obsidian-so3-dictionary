A planet in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Theta Sector]]</span> which is relatively close to the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Sol System]]</span>.
The blood of the <span class="races">[[Felinefolk]]</span> who live on this planet can be processed and used to manufacture a material that is able to absorb nearly 100% of all light wavelengths between 240 and 780 nm.  This caused <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Roak]]</span> to get pulled into a war between the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Terran Alliance]]</span> and <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Lesonia]]</span> in the middle of the 4th century <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>.
Estimates of the number of <span class="races">[[Felinefolk]]</span> that were abducted from <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Roak]]</span> and taken to <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Lesonia]]</span> during this period vary from several hundred thousand to several million.
In 446 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>, <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Roak]]</span> signed an alliance with <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Earth]]</span>.
In 450 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>, <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Roak]]</span> joined the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span>.
...Or so we are told.
