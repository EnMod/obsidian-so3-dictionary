A great ruin found underground between <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Surferio]]</span> and <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Irisa Fields]]</span>.
It was seemingly built in the early years of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Ancient Kingdom of Aquor]]</span>, which makes it not as ancient as most people would think.  It still stands, with no hope of repair, after being destroyed in the war between <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Ancient Kingdom of Aquor|Aquor]]</span> and <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Greeton|Greeton]]</span>.
