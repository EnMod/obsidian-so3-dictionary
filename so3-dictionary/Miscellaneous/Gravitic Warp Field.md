A special field that is projected in the direction of travel via <span class="miscellaneous">[[Gravitic Warp|gravitic warp]]</span>.
The space inside this field is compressed to a much greater degree than ordinary space, so ships and other objects traveling through the field can exceed the speed of light relative to ordinary space.
