A metallic element with the atomic number of 80, <span class="miscellaneous">[[Mercury|mercury]]</span> has an atomic mass of 200.59, a <span class="miscellaneous">[[Melting Point|melting point]]</span> of -38.842 degrees centigrade, and a density of 13.546 g/c<sup>3</sup>.  <span class="miscellaneous">[[Mercury]]</span> is used inside the latest <span class="miscellaneous">[[Runological Weapon|runological weapons]]</span>.  When materials such as <span class="miscellaneous">[[Silver|silver]]</span> that have a higher level of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Electronegativity|electronegativity]]</span> than mercury are dissolved in a solvent and used as conductive material, those materials separate after electricity is channeled through them.  This is why the internals of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Thunder Arrow]]</span> cannot be constructed with metals such as gold or <span class="miscellaneous">[[Silver|silver]]</span>.
