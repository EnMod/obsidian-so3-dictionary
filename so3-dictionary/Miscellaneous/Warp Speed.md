One method of expressing faster-than-light speeds.  This unit represents the relative distance traveled in normal space during a set amount of time.
This unit does not refer to actual speed at all, but rather to the distance between the measured start coordinate and measured end coordinate in normal space.
When the actual distance an object has moved at <span class="miscellaneous">[[Warp Speed|warp speed]]</span> is measured, it is always 2N-1 times the distance traveled by light in normal space.
