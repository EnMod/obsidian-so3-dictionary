A machine that emits special gravity waves in the area around it, in order to jam transportation by affecting the generation of quanta that occurs during the transportation process.
When transportation is attempted when a machine of this nature is in operation, although the matter inside the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Transporter|transporter]]</span> will be disintegrated as always, nothing will appear at the destination.  In this case, the matter transported is lost.
Therefore all <span class="miscellaneous">[[Transporter|transporters]]</span> in use nowadays come equipped with a system to detect gravity waves at the destination, and will not attempt to transport into the field of effect of a <span class="miscellaneous">[[Transport Jammer|transport jammer]]</span>.
