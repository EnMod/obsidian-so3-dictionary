A system developed in 207 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span> that can disintegrate an object in one place, send an exact replica to any other place, and reintegrate it at the quantum level.
In the past, it was believed that <span class="miscellaneous">[[Heisenberg's Uncertainty Principle]]</span> would prevent any transportation system of this nature from working, but the development of this technology has allowed a sort of pseudo-transportation system to be implemented.
