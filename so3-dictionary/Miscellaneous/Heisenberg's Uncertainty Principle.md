One of the core principles of quantum mechanics that states that "the momentum and coordinate of any subatomic particle cannot both be known at the same time".
In other words, if you measure the location, the act of measurement itself will actually change the momentum of that subatomic particle.  
Conversely, if you measure the momentum, then there will be no way to simultaneously measure the location.
This does not mean that you cannot know the coordinate or momentum of a particle before you measure it, but rather that particles are made up of a combination of a wide variety of possibilities, and really have no specific location or momentum.  There is no way to know the results until you actually take a measurement.
This physics theory is so powerful it even has philosophical 
ramifications, and is no less important nowadays in the <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span> era than it was in the era before space travel.
