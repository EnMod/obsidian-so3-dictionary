A completely new type of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Force Field|force field]]</span> that began to be researched when <span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Energy|creation energy]]</span> was first discovered.
Unlike previous energy fields comprised of electromagnetic radiation, this field blocks energy in the fourth dimension by actually interfering with space-time itself, preventing it from conveying the energy.
In other words, whereas previous shields could only block the target enemy type, <span class="miscellaneous">[[Space-Time Displacement Shield|space-time displacement shields]]</span> actually reflect the energy into another dimension.
This is why this new type of shield can block <span class="miscellaneous">[[Magnitude|magnitudes]]</span> more energy than previously utilized shields such as electromagnetic shields.
