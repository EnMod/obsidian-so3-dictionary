This particle was theoretically derived from the need to explain the warping effect of an object's mass on space-time, it is perceived as a latent energy that has no effect outside the particle.
The existence of this particle was postulated in order to explain the actual phenomenon whereby the mass of an object will warp space-time, before the nature and effect of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Alterable Space|alterable space (altspace)]]</span> were understood.
After physicists came to understand <span class="miscellaneous">[[Alterable Space|altspace]]</span>, it became apparent that rather than mass creating the force of gravity, the existence of matter warps space-time in such a way that the apparent force of gravity results, and this effectively disproves the existence of "gravity" itself.
Regardless, the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Graviton|graviton]]</span> still survives as one of the tools used to help explain the extremely confusing effects of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Alterable Space|altspace]]</span>.
