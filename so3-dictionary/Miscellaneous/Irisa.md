This major goddess of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Church of Apris]]</span> is the eldest of three sisters represented by the moons.  These three goddesses are also the wives of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Apris]]</span>, the Sun God.
<span class="political-bodies-places">[[Elicoor II]]</span> has three moons of various sizes, named <span class="miscellaneous">[[Irisa]]</span>, <span class="miscellaneous">[[Erinia]]</span>, and <span class="miscellaneous">[[Palmira]]</span>, and the Church teaches that these moons are the triplet wives of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Apris]]</span>, the Sun God.
Usually when a planet such as <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Elicoor II]]</span> has multiple large moons, the ebb and flow of the tides has a major effect, but in the case of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Elicoor II]]</span>, the gravitational effects of the two smaller moons are precisely offset by the gravity of the largest moon, Irisa, and in an arrangement so rare as to be miraculous, the three moons revolve around the planet in a synchronized orbit such that the center of the gravity of the three is located inside the planet itself.
