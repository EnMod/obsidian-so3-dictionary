A mysterious night on <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Elicoor II]]</span> when all of the stars disappeared from the sky.
Incidentally, this phenomenon occurred at the exact time that <span class="people">[[Luther Lansfeld|Luther]]</span> entered the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Eternal Sphere]]</span>.
Perhaps it was a result of a data processing bug temporarily affecting the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Eternal Sphere]]</span> when the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Uninstaller]]</span> was activated.
