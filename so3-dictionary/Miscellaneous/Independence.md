One of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Battle-Class Ship|battle-class ships]]</span> of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span>.
This ship was able to destroy one <span class="races">[[Executioners|Executioner]]</span> by predicting its 
movements and hitting it with all of the ship's <span class="miscellaneous">[[Quantum Torpedo|quantum torpedoes]]</span> in an incredibly lucky volley.
Thus the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Independence]]</span> was awarded a somewhat pyrrhic Award of 
Outstanding Achievement for giving hope to the military forces of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span>.
Of course, the Independence was destroyed immediately after this accomplishment.
