A tablet of ten precepts that must be strictly adhered to, which Saint <span class="people">[[Ronaldo Dyne]]</span> is said to have received from <span class="miscellaneous">[[Elena]]</span>, Goddess of Light in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Shrine of Kaddan]]</span>.
Whether or not this tablet is truly from the goddess <span class="miscellaneous">[[Elena]]</span>, the precepts inscribed upon it seem too insightful to have been written during a feudal age.
