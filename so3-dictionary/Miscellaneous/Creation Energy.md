Research on this completely new type of energy system began after a discovery in the second half of the 4th century <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>, and practical applications based on the system first appeared in the first half of the 8th century <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>.
This system, which was discovered in an ancient ruin on the planet <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Milokeenia]]</span>, describes a system wherein part of the energy that exists in imaginary number space is drawn into three-dimensional space.  
Theoretically, this type of system could produce an essentially infinite amount of energy.
Of course, since no type of material or electromagnetic shield can withstand the tremendous amounts of energy created by this system, the use of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Energy|creation energy]]</span> is strictly limited to special areas of space surrounded by <span class="miscellaneous">[[Space-Time Displacement Shield|space-time displacement shields]]</span>.
