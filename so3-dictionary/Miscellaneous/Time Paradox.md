Wormer published his paper on the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Space-Time Discontinuity Effect|space-time discontinuity effect]]</span>, in which he postulated that even without a major paradox such as the one described above, if a single speck of dust, or even a single electron were to travel in time, it would have a major effect on the present.
