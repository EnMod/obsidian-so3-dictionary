A treaty aimed at protecting planets with civilizations that are not yet fully developed.  <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation|Federation]]</span> laws strictly prohibit contact with such civilizations.
The reason for this is because contact with higher civilizations often greatly influences the path of history of underdeveloped worlds.  All citizens and groups belonging to the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> are required to adhere to this treaty, unless there is a clear and present danger to a person's life.
This treaty is one of the most important sets of rules in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span>, and delineates how citizens must act in emergency situations.
Of course, in certain quarters, this treaty is thought to exist in name only.
