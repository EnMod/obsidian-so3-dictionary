Unlike the usual visual <span class="miscellaneous">[[Magnitude|magnitude]]</span> system, which compares the apparent brightness of stars as viewed from a specific planet, this unit was created to compare the actual brightness of stars.
This unit gives the brightness of a star when viewed from a specific distance of ten parsecs (32.6 light years).
