A new warp theory developed by Dr. Krupp in 537 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>, which enabled travel at speeds that greatly exceed those previously possible via <span class="miscellaneous">[[Subspace Warp|subspace warp]]</span>.
The system works by controlling the gravitational dimension that ordinarily propagates through <span class="miscellaneous">[[Alterable Space|altspace]]</span> and using it to directly warp space in front of the ship, compressing it in such a way as to effectively enable extremely high-speed travel through three-dimensional space.
Almost all large vessels nowadays utilize <span class="miscellaneous">[[Gravitic Warp|gravitic warp]]</span> systems.
