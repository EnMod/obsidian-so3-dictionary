Assume that person A has traveled three seconds back in time.  For three seconds, the person A before the time travel (A1) and the person A coming back from three seconds in the future (A2) will exist simultaneously, overlapping in time.
If, after three seconds pass, A1 travels back into the past, then no problem will occur.  But if A2 should prevent this from happening somehow, what would happen?
This <span class="miscellaneous">[[Space-Time Discontinuity Effect]]</span> has been proposed as one possible answer to the question.
According to Professor J.D. Wormer, who published this theory, the simultaneous existence of identical matter in the same space-time puts a tremendous strain on that space, so if a situation occurs whereby a person travels to the past and prevents his own movement through time, then as a result, person A will be infinitely duplicated, and three-dimensional space will contract into the singularity caused by the infinite mass created.
In the same paper, Professor J.D. Wormer also predicts that if this type of phenomenon were to occur in the future, then the amount of mass in three-dimensional space would shrink to zero, and the dimensions themselves would revert to nothingness.
