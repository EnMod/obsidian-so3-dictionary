The movement of free-flowing electrons that are not attached to any atoms.  Electrons are one of the building blocks of matter, along with protons and neutrons.
In general, an <span class="miscellaneous">[[Electric Current|electric current]]</span> flows from positively to negatively charged areas, but the electrons themselves actually flow in the negative to positive direction.
This may sound like two completely different phenomena, but in 
actuality, they are one and the same.
Electricity has always been defined as flowing in that direction in terms of electronic designs, but the electrons physically flow in the opposite direction.
