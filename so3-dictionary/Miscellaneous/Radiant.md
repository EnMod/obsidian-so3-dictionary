One of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Battle-Class Ship|battle-class ships]]</span> of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span>.
This ship took a hit in the engine section during a battle with the <span class="races">[[Executioners]]</span>, and was eventually destroyed in an explosion of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Energy|creation energy]]</span>.
Unlike most of the other ships, the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Radiant]]</span> was not destroyed 
instantaneously.  In a way, this may have been unfortunate for the crew.
