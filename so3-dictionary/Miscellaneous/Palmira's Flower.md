A beautiful, sweetly fragrant flower that represents the primary goddess <span class="miscellaneous">[[Palmira]]</span>, one of the three moon goddesses.
Individual flowers have short life spans, but they tend to grow in clusters, and they have no specific blooming season, so they seem to always be blooming in a wild profusion as one flower after another opens its petals randomly.
This is why places where this flower blooms are thought to be "the closest places to Heaven on <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Elicoor II|Elicoor]]</span>".
In the language of flowers, this flower means "eternal beauty".
