A distance unit defined on <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Earth]]</span> during the pre-<span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span> era as the average distance from <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Earth]]</span> to its star, Sol.
When converted to metric measurements, this works out to around 149.6 million kilometers.
Since many of the life forms encountered in the galaxy have lived on planets at approximately the same distance from their own stars, this unit still enjoys widespread use, even in the <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span> era.
