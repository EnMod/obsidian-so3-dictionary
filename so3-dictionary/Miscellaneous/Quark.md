One of the anti-<span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation|Federation]]</span> organizations that is based on <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Klaus III]]</span>.
<span class="miscellaneous">[[Quark]]</span> has expanded its reach greatly in recent years, and is now so large that neither the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> nor the <span class="races">[[Klausian]]</span> government can afford to ignore it.
Apparently, <span class="miscellaneous">[[Quark|Quark's]]</span> new leader has changed recently, and the new leader's charisma has been drawing in many <span class="races">[[Klausian|Klausians]]</span> who until recently has followed a policy of non-interference with respect to the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation|Federation]]</span>.

# Part 2

There is no doubt that the Federation's system of government allows it to easily attain the approval of the masses.
However, there are many people in the Milky Way galaxy who do not desire to live under such a system.
Neutral parties are drawn into the Pangalactic Congress where they are denounced, and then the federal will is imposed as the will of the "sweeping majority".
The will of those who are too weak militarily or economically to stand up to the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation|Federation]]</span> is suppressed as a "minority opinion".  This is a facet of that bloated giant known as the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> that many cannot abide.
<span class="miscellaneous">[[Quark]]</span> is an organization that aims at using mediation to bring together forces that desire <span class="miscellaneous">[[Independence|independence]]</span> or true autonomy from the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation|Federation]]</span>, in order to win complete self-rule.
