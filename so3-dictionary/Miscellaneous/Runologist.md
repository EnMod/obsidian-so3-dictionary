One who serves the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Sacred Kingdom of Aquaria]]</span> by utilizing a technique known as <span class="miscellaneous">[[Runology|runology]]</span>.
Since only a very small number of people are initiated into the art of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Runology|runology]]</span>, the ability to use these techniques alone marks a person as an important individual.
Although some <span class="miscellaneous">[[Runologist|runologists]]</span> do not serve <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Aquaria|Aquaria]]</span>, these few exceptions to the rule are almost all people who have absconded from the kingdom themselves, students of teachers who have done so, or retirees.
