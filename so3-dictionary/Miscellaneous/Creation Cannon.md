The <span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Energy|creation energy]]</span>-based cannons used by ships in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> military.
Since these guns use <span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Energy|creation energy]]</span> as an energy source, they are far more destructive than the antimatter cannons that used to be the mainstay of ship-to-ship weaponry.
However, <span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Cannon|creation cannons]]</span> are far more difficult to control.  In 732 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>, the time-space displacement shield inside the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Battleship|battleship]]</span> Tilgrem's primary cannon malfunctioned, resulting in an explosion that annihilated an entire planet from this universe!
For this reason, <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation|Federation]]</span> law stipulates extremely severe 
restrictions regarding the use of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Creation Cannon|creation cannons]]</span>.
