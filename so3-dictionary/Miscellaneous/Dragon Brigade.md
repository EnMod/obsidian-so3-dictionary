One of the three military branches of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Airyglyph]]</span>, made up of flying knights mounted on <span class="races">[[Air Dragon|air dragons]]</span>.
This small, elite mobile force mainly conducts surprise attacks and assaults on enemy encampments, as well as scouting missions that take advantage of their ability to fly.
The three branches of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Airyglyph]]</span> military (<span class="miscellaneous">[[Storm Brigade]]</span>, <span class="miscellaneous">[[Black Brigade]]</span>, and <span class="races">[[Dragon Brigade]]</span>) are officially equal in rank.  But due to the nature of the missions assigned to the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Dragon Brigade]]</span>, its captain is authorized to issue royal commands.  So it would be no exaggeration to say that the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Dragon Brigade|Dragon Brigade's]]</span> captain is also the commander-in-chief of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Airyglyph|Airyglyph]]</span> military.
<span class="people">[[Duke Vox]]</span>, who is also commander-in-chief of the Peacekeeping Force, is the current captain of this brigade.
