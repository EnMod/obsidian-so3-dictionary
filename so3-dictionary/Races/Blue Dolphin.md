A marine race that lives in the city of Orba, which lies underneath an ocean on the planet <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Expel]]</span>.
As it is readily apparent, <span class="races">[[Blue Dolphin|Blue Dolphins]]</span> are descended from dolphins, but the race actually evolved the ability to live on land due to planetary pollution caused by the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Energy Stone]]</span> in 366 <span class="miscellaneous">[[SD]]</span>.
However, the <span class="races">[[Blue Dolphin|Blue Dolphins]]</span> have a rough time living on land because their skin dries easily, and they can never stray too far from water.
