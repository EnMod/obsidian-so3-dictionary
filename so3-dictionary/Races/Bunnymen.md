A race of mammals that resemble rotund rabbits and have somehow spread throughout the galaxy.
<span class="races">[[Bunnymen]]</span> are extremely friendly, and possess the odd ability to appear anywhere, at any time, when called with a special sound.
Extremely swift-footed and reasonably strong, they are prized as beasts of burden on some planets.
