A sentient race living on the planet <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Rezerb]]</span>, in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Zeta Sector]]</span>.
<span class="races">[[Rezerbian|Rezerbians]]</span> resemble leeches in that they live by sucking fluids from other organisms.
<span class="races">[[Rezerbian|Rezerbians]]</span> are highly susceptible to damage by short wavelengths of light such as ultraviolet, and without the special suits that they always wear, their skin would burn to a crisp after several hours of exposure to sunlight.
On the other hand, <span class="races">[[Rezerbian|Rezerbians]]</span> possess excellent regenerative abilities, and it has been said that they can fully recover from the loss of all four limbs after six months.
