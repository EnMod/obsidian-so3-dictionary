An equine mammal that inhabits many regions of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Elicoor II]]</span>.
<span class="races">[[Lum|Lums]]</span> are used in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Airyglyph]]</span> as mounts due to their innate speed and power, but due to their volatile nature, they only see wide use in battle and security functions.
Since <span class="races">[[Lum]]</span> horns were once prized for their effectiveness as a virility enhancer, the wild <span class="races">[[Lum]]</span> was nearly over-hunted to extinction.
