A mysterious race of fairies that stand about 50 centimeters tall and live in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Sanmite Republic]]</span>.
<span class="races">[[Bubblehearts]]</span> are able to float and move freely about through the air thanks to the power of the gem necklaces they wear.
Sadly, most of their legs have completely atrophied, and now lack the ability to support their own weight.
If these extremely rare fairies live nearby, hide in the shadows and watch them on a windy day.  Their struggles not to get blown away is good for a laugh.
