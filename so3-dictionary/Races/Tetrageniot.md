A race that lives in a group of four artificial satellites that orbit the planet <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Tetragenesis]]</span>, in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Eta Sector]]</span>.
The <span class="races">[[Tetrageniot|Tetrageniots]]</span> have a strict social structure, and the society is run by four noble houses, one in each satellite.  Decisions for all <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Tetrageniot|Tetrageniots]]</span> are made at councils that are convened from court nobles of all four houses.
The most distinguishing characteristic of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Tetrageniot|Tetrageniots]]</span> is without doubt the third eye in the middle of their forehead.
<span class="races">[[Tetrageniot|Tetrageniots]]</span> make some the best gunners around.  Since they are able to see things with a total of three eyes, their spatial perception is superior to most other races.
