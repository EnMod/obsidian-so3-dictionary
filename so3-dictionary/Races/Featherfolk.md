A race of people with large wings on their backs, descended from birds.
The process of evolution has split the humerus bone of the <span class="races">[[Featherfolk]]</span> in two, allowing this remarkable race to possess both wings and arms.
<span class="races">[[Featherfolk]]</span> are extremely light, and can use the wings on their backs to fly for a short period of time.
