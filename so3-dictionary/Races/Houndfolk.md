A half-<span class="races">[[Human|human]]</span>, half-beast race that lives in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Sanmite Republic]]</span>.
<span class="races">[[Houndfolk]]</span> live in a strict hierarchy of dominance, and will completely subjugate their will to any person they recognize as being socially superior, obeying the superior's every command.
Life-threatening commands are no exception.
Actually, not only are life-threatening commands not an exception, the more dangerous a command, the more the command's recipient feels that he is being trusted by his superior, and the more likely that he will faithfully carry it out.
On the other hand, the <span class="races">[[Houndfolk]]</span> are also known for treating those they see as socially inferior in an extremely cold manner.  This social structure makes the <span class="races">[[Houndfolk]]</span> a strange and difficult race to deal with.
