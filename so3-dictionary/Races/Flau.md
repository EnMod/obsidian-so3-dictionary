An adorable, 30 centimeter tall race that has large wings growing from their backs.
The <span class="races">[[Flau]]</span> generally have cheerful personalities, and spend their lives flitting around flower gardens and licking the nectar off flowers.
For whatever reason, this race is known to have an unusually high percentage of women, and beautiful women at that.
The <span class="races">[[Flau]]</span> are also known as "fairies" and area mischievous race.
