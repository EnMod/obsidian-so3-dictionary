A sentient race of half-<span class="races">[[Human|human]]</span>, half-fish people living in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Sanmite Republic]]</span>.
The <span class="races">[[Lousyd|Lousyds]]</span> are the unfortunate (?) result of plankton in waters infused with a powerful <span class="miscellaneous">[[Runological Force|runological force]]</span> evolving at a highly accelerated rate.
For whatever reason, <span class="races">[[Lousyd|Lousyds]]</span> hate Orichalcums, and when one is brought too near, they emit a strange noise and try to run away.
Perhaps Orichalcums react in some way to the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Runology|runological]]</span> force stored inside the <span class="races">[[Lousyd|Lousyd's]]</span> body, or cause a resonance effect.  This phenomenon remains a mystery--mainly because no one has ever attempted to find the reason for it.
