A mischief-loving race that lives in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Sanmite Republic]]</span>.  <span class="races">[[Drowglynn|Drowglynns]]</span> enjoy stealing things and causing injuries, so they are not liked by other races.
On the other hand, nobody despises them because few <span class="races">[[Drowglynn]]</span> companions die due to accident or disease.  It is theorized that by creating their own misfortune, the <span class="races">[[Drowglynn]]</span> deplete the bad luck around them, thereby protecting themselves from more serious calamities.
The power of the <span class="races">[[Drowglynn]]</span> is truly mystifying.
