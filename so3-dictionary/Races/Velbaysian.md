A nomadic race without a single specific home, that wanders throughout the universe in clan-based groups.
<span class="races">[[Velbaysian|Velbaysians]]</span> possess a highly acute nervous system that makes them extremely talented in feats that require precise movements, such as acrobatics and magic tricks.  They are also well known for their extraordinary explosive muscle power, which regularly amazes members of other races.
However, <span class="races">[[Velbaysian|Velbaysians]]</span> are not very good at eliminating lactic acid from their muscle fibers, so they cannot use their superior abilities for long.
