A type of <span class="races">[[Executioners|Executioner]]</span> that proclaims destruction.
<span class="races">[[Proclaimer|Proclaimers]]</span> are shaped like <span class="races">[[Human|human]]</span> females and unlike the <span class="races">[[Enforcer|Enforcers]]</span>, which exist only to destroy, these <span class="races">[[Executioners]]</span> are also capable of intelligent action.
These <span class="races">[[Executioners]]</span> were sent directly to <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Moonbase]]</span>, the "source of all evil", in order to board and annihilate the facility.
