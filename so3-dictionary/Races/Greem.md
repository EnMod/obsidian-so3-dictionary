A frog-like race that has taken up residence in <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Surferio]]</span>. 
<span class="races">[[Greem|Greems]]</span> can breathe through either lungs or gills, so they can live on land as well as underwater.
To be more precise, they need to live both on land as well as underwater and cannot survive with access to only one of the other environment.  <span class="races">[[Greem]]</span> skin dries in the air, and <span class="races">[[Greem]]</span> bodies are too fragile to withstand a high level of water pressure for long.  
Therefore, <span class="races">[[Greem|Greems]]</span> must live near clear and shallow bodies of water.
