A race living on the underdeveloped third planet of the Vanguard system.
Due to their planet's low gravity, <span class="races">[[Vanguardian|Vanguardians]]</span> only possess 70% of the physical strength of <span class="races">[[Earthling|Earthlings]]</span>.
Since <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Vanguard III]]</span> is an underdeveloped planet a detailed survey has not been conducted, but the race living on the planet is thought to fall into the <span class="races">[[Human|human]]</span> category.
Other than their pointy ears, <span class="races">[[Vanguardian|Vanguardians]]</span> appear to have no particularly interesting or unique characteristics.
