A sentient race living in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Aldian Empire]]</span>, the primary rival of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span>.
Not only have the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> and the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Aldian Empire]]</span> been in a constant state of war ever since first contact, since <span class="races">[[Aldian]]</span> <span class="miscellaneous">[[Battleship|battleships]]</span> self-destruct without fail after losing a battle, absolutely no information is available about this civilization.

# Part 2

The <span class="races">[[Aldian|Aldians]]</span> were actually part of a single organism that was entirely dependent upon its home planet from birth.
The organism had multiple bodies, all of which could act independently, but which were controlled by a single mind located on the <span class="races">[[Aldian]]</span> home world.
This explains why the <span class="races">[[Aldian]]</span> placed such a small value on individual life forms.
The idea of individual bodies, each imbued with a separate spirit, was completely incomprehensible to this entity.
