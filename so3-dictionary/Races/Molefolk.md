A race descended from moles, and which lives in places such as the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Mosel Dunes]]</span>, <span class="races">[[Molefolk]]</span> have extremely large palms with sharp claws that resemble shovels.
They are almost completely blind, but boast powerful senses of smell and hearing.
Since they primarily live underground their eyes are sensitive to light and they must always wear special darkened contact lenses when they venture out onto the surface (these contact lenses are made out of materials such as colored crystal or crystal glass).
