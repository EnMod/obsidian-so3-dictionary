A race descended from insects, standing around 80 centimeters tall.
Since <span class="races">[[Beegul|Beeguls]]</span> have an exoskeleton, their skin is extremely hard--so hard, in fact, that it can easily reflect the thrust of a dull sword.  
They can fly freely through the air with the two sets of two membranous wings they sport on their backs.
In general, they suffer from poor eyesight, but since they are so extremely powerful and make such excellent warriors, they are sought out as mercenaries by various nations.  <span class="races">[[Beegul|Beeguls]]</span> are pitch black in color and are relatively easy to recognize due to the large horns on their head.
