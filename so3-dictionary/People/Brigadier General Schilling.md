A man who plotted the assassination of <span class="people">[[Cliff Fittir|Cliff]]</span> while he was still <span class="miscellaneous">[[Quark|Quark's]]</span> leader.  He planned this in order to wipe out the organization, which he saw as a nuisance to the Federation.
This extremely self-centered man considered his own actions to be absolutely correct and beyond reproach.  Commanding the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Battleship]]</span> <span class="miscellaneous">[[Invisible]]</span>, <span class="people">[[Brigadier General Schilling|Schilling]]</span> almost succeeded in assassinating <span class="people">[[Cliff Fittir|Cliff]]</span>, but due to an extraordinary twist of fate, <span class="people">[[Maria Traydor|Maria]]</span>, who was also onboard the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Diplo]]</span> at the time, used her powers to literally delete the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Invisible]]</span> from this universe.
Of course, even if <span class="people">[[Brigadier General Schilling|Schilling]]</span> had succeeded in this assassination attempt, rather than a triumphant hero's welcome, a military tribunal and the death penalty were all that awaited his return.
