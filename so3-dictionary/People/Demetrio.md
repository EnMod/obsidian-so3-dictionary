A soldier in the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Dragon Brigade]]</span>, serving under <span class="people">[[Duke Vox|Vox]]</span>.
Although <span class="people">[[Demetrio]]</span> comes from a respectable house and possesses a reasonable level of military prowess and knowledge, he excels in no particular area.
He earned his position as second-in-command of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Dragon Brigade]]</span> through an unswerving loyalty to <span class="people">[[Duke Vox|Vox]]</span>, rather than due to any suitability for the job.
<span class="people">[[Demetrio]]</span> managed to attain his current post through a calculating veneer of tractability, more than anything else.

# Part 2

Most of <span class="people">[[Demetrio|Demetrio's]]</span> missions involved doing dirty work for <span class="people">[[Duke Vox|Vox]]</span>, including killing non-combatants and eliminating prisoners who know too much.
He probably did these things to further his own career, or to save his own neck, but unfortunately for him, fate decreed that he would be nothing more than a lapdog for <span class="people">[[Duke Vox|Vox]]</span> until the very end.
