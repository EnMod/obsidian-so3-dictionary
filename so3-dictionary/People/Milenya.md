A trueborn noble and head of one of the top two houses of the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Airyglyph]]</span>.
Recently, however, <span class="people">[[Milenya]]</span> has expressed objections to the war with the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Aquaria]]</span>, and this earned her the wrath of the powerful warmonger <span class="people">[[Duke Vox]]</span>.  <span class="people">[[Duke Vox|Vox]]</span> had her branded as a rebel and subjected to house arrest.
Unsurprisingly, not even <span class="people">[[Duke Vox|Vox]]</span> dared to execute the head of a noble house with such a long and distinguished heritage.  But even a punishment as light as house arrest must be difficult to endure for a woman who has known nothing but luxury since birth.
