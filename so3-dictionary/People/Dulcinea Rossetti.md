<span class="people">[[Dulcinea Rossetti|Dulcinea]]</span> was a close childhood friend of <span class="people">[[Elayne Rossetti|Elayne]]</span>, the mother of <span class="people">[[Peppita Rossetti|Peppita]]</span>.
When <span class="people">[[Elayne Rossetti|Elayne]]</span> met an untimely death, <span class="people">[[Dulcinea Rossetti|Dulcinea]]</span> took the orphaned <span class="people">[[Peppita Rossetti|Peppita]]</span> in without giving the matter a second though, and raised her as her own daughter.
