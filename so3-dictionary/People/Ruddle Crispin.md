A young traveler (and sometimes a traveling salesman trainee) who has traveled extensively but is actually incredibly poor with directions.  
<span class="people">[[Ruddle Crispin|Ruddle]]</span> makes his latest appearance with his friend <span class="people">[[Rumina G. Dogin|Rumina]]</span>, a girl he met during his wanderings.
It's anyone's guess whether he simply likes adventure or whether he is traveling in search of a particular goal.
Whatever the case may be, his natural ability to get lost has gotten him into more than one hundred scrapes throughout his life.
Incidentally, he claims to have never had a girlfriend.
