An ingenious alchemist who graduated second in his class from the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Runology|runological]]</span> school located inside <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Aquaria|Aquaria]]</span>, which he attended as a foreign exchange student.
<span class="people">[[Mackwell]]</span> is extremely fussy about his time's value, and always carries a schedule with each day's tasks listed down to the second.
Acting alone, this gifted alchemist and scholar derived a unification theory that ties <span class="miscellaneous">[[Channeled Force|channeled force]]</span> and magnetism, while working with <span class="people">[[Dion Landers|Dion]]</span> in <span class="people">[[Elena Frahm|Dr. Elena's]]</span> research lab.  This theory is what finally allowed the development of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Thunder Arrow]]</span> to proceed.
Unfortunately, after this breakthrough, <span class="people">[[Mackwell]]</span> grew fed up with <span class="people">[[Elena Frahm|Dr. Elena's]]</span> unstructured and carefree working style, and quit the research lab.
In lieu of a retirement package, <span class="people">[[Mackwell]]</span> made off with one of Elena's books, and still travels with it to this day.
