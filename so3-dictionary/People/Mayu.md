A girl living in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kirlsa Training Facility]]</span> who, along with her mother, takes care of the soldiers of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Black Brigade]]</span>.
<span class="people">[[Mayu]]</span> wears her heart on her sleeve, and tires of things easily, perhaps because her live involves day after day of nothing but repetitive chores around the training facility.
Even though she often dreams of blowing up and venting her anger at her tiresome existence, she's basically a harmless girl.
