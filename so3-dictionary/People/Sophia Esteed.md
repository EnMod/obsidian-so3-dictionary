A <span class="races">[[Human|human]]</span> girl born on <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Earth]]</span> who is enrolled in the Spacetime Department of Bachtein High School.  Unlike most young girls of the present age, she excels in various household tasks such as cleaning and sewing.  
There is a simple reason for this.  Her parents are both busy with work, and she has had to take care of the chores around the house by herself from an early age.
Incidentally, her father, <span class="people">[[Clive Esteed|Dr. Clive Esteed]]</span>, works at the same research lab as <span class="people">[[Fayt Leingod|Fayt's]]</span> parents, and her house is close to <span class="people">[[Fayt Leingod|Fayt's]]</span> house, so the two families have had a close relationship for a long time.

Surely it couldn't have been that much of a surprise to her!
