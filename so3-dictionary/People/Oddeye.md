A baron class <span class="races">[[Air Dragon|air dragon]]</span> and partner to <span class="people">[[Airyglyph XIII]]</span>, <span class="people">[[Oddeye|Oddeye's]]</span> name refers to the fact that his eyes are of two different colors.
Since, as the king, <span class="people">[[Airyglyph XIII]]</span> himself rarely stands on the field of battle, this pitiable creature has almost no role to play.
Incidentally, <span class="races">[[Air Dragon|air dragons]]</span> of the class achieved by <span class="people">[[Oddeye]]</span> and <span class="people">[[Crosell]]</span> boast an intellect that surpasses even that of <span class="races">[[Human|humans]]</span>, are masters of multiple languages, and wield a magic that is based on their language.
