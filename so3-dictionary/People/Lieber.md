A member of the anti-<span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation|Federation]]</span> group <span class="miscellaneous">[[Quark]]</span>, and brother of another <span class="miscellaneous">[[Quark]]</span> member by the name of <span class="people">[[Steeg]]</span>.
Also known as "Lieber the Quick-Draw" and "Steeg the Sharpshooter", the two brothers like to refer to themselves collectively as "the Binary Star Lazeria", but unfortunately, neither the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Pangalactic Federation]]</span> nor the fellow members of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Quark]]</span> refer to them by this nickname.
Incidentally, "Lazeria" is the name of a city on <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Klaus IV]]</span>, and the home town of <span class="people">[[Lieber]]</span>, <span class="people">[[Steeg]]</span>, and <span class="people">[[Marietta]]</span>.
