The mayor of the group of <span class="races">[[Humanoid|humanoids]]</span> who live above the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Lost City]]</span> of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Surferio]]</span>.
<span class="people">[[Aznor S. T. Huxley|Aznor]]</span> is extremely bad at remembering faces, and can only match names to faces for those who are in his immediate circle.
(How did this guy get to be the mayor, anyway?)
Of course, he is blissfully unaware of this failing.
