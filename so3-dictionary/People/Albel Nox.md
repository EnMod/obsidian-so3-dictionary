# Part 2

During <span class="people">[[Albel Nox|Albel's]]</span> <span class="miscellaneous">[[Accession of the Flame]]</span> ceremony, which occurred when he was fifteen years old, he failed to take his place among the knights of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Dragon Brigade]]</span> when he was unable to release his own individual feelings and commune with the spirit of the <span class="races">[[Air Dragon|air dragon]]</span>.
He should have died for his hubris as the <span class="races">[[Dragon|dragons]]</span> breathed their fury upon him, but his father <span class="people">[[Glou Nox]]</span> shielded him with his own body and bore the brunt of the flames, saving his life (although Albel did lose his left arm in this incident).
