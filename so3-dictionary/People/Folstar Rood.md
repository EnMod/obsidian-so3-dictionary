An ex-programmer who used to work on the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Eternal Sphere]]</span> development team at <span class="miscellaneous">[[Sphere]]</span>.
<span class="people">[[Folstar Rood|Folstar's]]</span> work was of unacceptable quality, he failed to meet 
deadlines, and he was irresponsible.  He thought that all he had to do was show up and spend eight hours a day at the company.  
Unsurprisingly, the areas he programmed were always full of major bugs.  
As a result, he was fired almost immediately.
<span class="people">[[Folstar Rood|Folstar]]</span> himself still believes to this day that he was the victim of a power struggle at the company.
