A stiff-haired girl who follows <span class="people">[[Fayt Leingod|Fayt]]</span> and his companions around, saying, "No more, five years before! No more, seven years before!" as if it were some sort of key phrase, for no apparent reason.
This odd phrase may make perfect sense to those who understand its context, but it means nothing at all to <span class="people">[[Fayt Leingod|Fayt]]</span>.  It's almost as if a desire for revenge is filling her with rage and makes her pick fights.
