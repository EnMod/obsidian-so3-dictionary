A huge <span class="races">[[Rondo Lukian]]</span> strongman and member of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Rossetti Troupe]]</span>.
<span class="people">[[Ursus]]</span> is from a rare Rondo Lukian bloodline of giants who are even larger than the average <span class="races">[[Rondo Lukian]]</span>, and shows off his prodigious strength by easily ripping <span class="miscellaneous">[[Iron|iron]]</span> chains, bars, and other items apart.
Although he rarely speaks of his own accord, <span class="people">[[Ursus]]</span> is actually pretty talkative for a member of his clan.
