Although retired at present, <span class="people">[[Ansala]]</span> used to be the best or second best practitioner of <span class="miscellaneous">[[Runology|runology]]</span> in the <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Sacred Kingdom of Aquaria]]</span>.
This lonely man poured too much of himself into his work to ever marry, and in spite of the fact that he has already retired, he can still be seen wandering the halls of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Castle Aquaria]]</span>, alternately gladdening and annoying the inhabitants thereof.
<span class="people">[[Ansala|Ansala's]]</span> skills are unquestioned, and his record is excellent, making him a difficult individual for the current <span class="miscellaneous">[[Runologist|runologists]]</span> to simply brush off.
