The uncle of <span class="people">[[Airyglyph XIII]]</span>, the current King of <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Airyglyph]]</span>, as well as the captain of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Dragon Brigade]]</span>, <span class="political-bodies-places">[[Kingdom of Airyglyph|Airyglyph's]]</span> aerial assault unit.
Having survived <span class="people">[[Airyglyph XIII|Airyglyph XIII's]]</span> major reformation, <span class="people">[[Duke Vox|Vox]]</span> certainly possesses considerable skills, but since he disdains the pride and honor of knights, and will do absolutely anything to win, he does not get along very well with people who put the pride of a warrior first, such as the captain of the <span class="miscellaneous">[[Storm Brigade]]</span>.
Incidentally, <span class="people">[[Duke Vox|Vox]]</span>  does not get along with <span class="people">[[Albel Nox|Albel]]</span> (the captain of the Black Brigade) either, but this seems to be simply a case of two strong personalities butting heads.
